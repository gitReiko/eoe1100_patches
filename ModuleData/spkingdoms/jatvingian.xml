	text="{=jatvingian_kingdom_text}In 983 Prince Volodymyr I Sviatoslavych burned down the regional Jatvingian center on the place of modern Franapol and subjugated these lands. Brest became the frontier fortress of Rus and the main economic center of the region. Further attempts Rus to subdue the Jatvingian lands were unsuccessful. Usually on the territory of western Belarus draw Grodno Principality, which was part of Volhynia or Polatsk. On the lands of Rus existed hundreds of settlements with the name Goroden or similar. But there is no convincing evidence why it is exactly modern Grodno. The possessions of Volhynia knyaz Davyd Igorovich were in the region of Pogorynje. Rather there was located the Princedom, and Horoden is the modern Davyd-Haradok. In the 13th century there are many written reports about the region. They are related to the attempt of the Volhynia Principality to capture  these lands. But they were already part of the Lithuanian Kingdom. After a successful invasion in 1258, Ruthenian king of Danylo Romanovych succeeded in capturing the VaÅ­kavysk princedom, for a short time. The further destiny of the Jatvingian principalities is connected with joining to the Lithuania for resistance to common enemies: Golden Horde, Ruthenian Kingdom and Teutonic Order.">
