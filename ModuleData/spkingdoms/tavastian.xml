		   text="{=tavastia.text}Few records about the 12th century Tavastians are known. Therefore, the main source is modern archaeology. In 1143 the Karelians raided Tavastians. The core area of ancient Tavastia was formed around Lake Vanajavesi. Example of organized cooperation of iron age Tavastians are the hillforts that form a clear line in south-north direction around HÃ¤meenlinna. Most remarkable from these hillforts is the Rapola Castle which is the biggest hillfort found in Finland, but also Tenhola hillfort in Hattula and Hakoinen Castle were important fortresses. Villages were often developed around the fortresses and for example Hattula and Vanaja-Janakkala had their beginning in this way. The Novgorod First Chronicle describes Tavastians in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and Karelians as well as other Baltic Finns from the 11th to 14th centuries.">
