  <string id="str_culture_description.latvian" text="{=latviandescription}The Baltic tribes were divided into 2 large groups: Eastern and Western. The Western Balts consisted of the Curonian, Prussian, and Yotvingian ethnicities. The Eastern Balts consisted of Samogitia, Lithuania, Selonia, Semigallia and Latgalia ethnicities. No one ethnos had a unified state. Many principalities traded, allied and fought each other. In case of threat the principalities created alliances, for example, in 1106 Semigallians defeated a large army of Polatsk and stopped its expansion into their region. The Northern Crusades stopped the natural process of formation of the Baltic States. Some ethnicities were destroyed, others conquered, the rest united to fight a common enemy. Today exists two Baltic nations, Latvia and Lithuania. Lithuania was able to create a powerful state and unite many Baltic and Slavic ethnic groups. Latvia was formed from the Teutonic Order, which conquered the Balts during the Northern Crusades." />
