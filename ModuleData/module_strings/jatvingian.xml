  <string id="str_culture_description.jatvingian" text="{=jatvingiandescription}The Novgorod principality began to form in the 9th century and existed until 1478. During this time the fourth Eastern Slavic ethnos was formed, which no longer exists. The Balto-Slavic ethnoses consisted of the Ilmen Slavs and Kryviches. But the basis of the population were Finnish tribes Izhorians, Karelians, Vepsians, Votians and other. Relations between ethnic groups evolved from simple tribute collection to full integration into the society. The Finns were assimilated and Slavicized. But the Finns had played an important role in the republic from the beginning and held quite a high position. For example, the name of the famous Novgorodian river pirates and mercenaries, Ushkuyniks, is a Finnish word that means boat, Ushkuyniks consisted of Slavs and Finns. Besides, the Ushkuyniks were a noble social class. In 1479, the Novgorod Republic was conquered and its ethnos partly exterminated, partly assimilated." />
